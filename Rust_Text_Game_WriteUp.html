<h2 id="what-was-built">What was built</h2>
<p>I set out to create a small text adventure game in Rust.<br>
In its current state, what I built is a small text adventure game with less features than I wanted, but with a couple features that I honestly didn’t expect I’d be able to implement.</p>
<p>Current features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic saving when quitting the game.</li>
<li>Ability to load saved game from main menu.</li>
<li>A map with 11 total rooms.</li>
<li>The ability to move the player from room to room with the ‘go’ command.</li>
<li>The ability to interact with objects in the rooms with the ‘look’ command.</li>
<li>Non-player characters (2 total) that the player can interact with using the ‘talk’ command.</li>
<li>Locked areas that must be interacted with in order to access, using the ‘look’ command.</li>
<li>Locked areas that can only be accessed after collecting a certain item or talking to a certain NPC.</li>
<li>Relatively fleshed-out room descriptions, item descriptions, and NPC dialogue.</li>
<li>NPCs give quests, accept quest items, and then end quests after they have received them.</li>
<li>The ability for the player to reach an area that causes the game to end. Essentially, a way to win the game that makes some sense.</li>
</ul>
<p>The map implementation is extremely rudimentary, in that it just consists of a number that corresponds to a set of information returned from functions in the room module. There is no Room struct or Map struct. There is no Player struct either.<br>
The game state, however, is abstracted out to a struct that carries basic player info and various flags that denote the actions or accomplishments of the player.<br>
NPCs also have their own struct and their own status flags, etc.<br>
main is given a Vec of NPCs to work with, which may or may not make things more usable as the number of NPCs is scaled up.<br>
Some helper functions that are used in multiple modules are defined in their own module: helpers.<br>
Most of the text descriptions, dialogue, etc. was extracted out to and is read from external files located in the data folder.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-worked">How it worked</h2>
<p>I first tried to make a Room struct and a Player struct to manage the basic functionality of movement and player status, but (predictably) this quickly turned into a giant fight with the borrow checker. I decided to scrap the OOP idea after toiling with it for a few hours and go with a more minimalistic (and less usable) approach. This worked out okay, but as I learned more about Rust and got more practice, I decided to use structs for most everything else with minimal hassle, so I think that I would use a more “structured” approach if I were to start a similar project now.<br>
One thing that I thought was a bit ambitious but decided to try anyways, was the addition of NPCs. I wasn’t sure I’d be able to pull it off in the time frame, but I did (with relative success). That being said, I spent the majority of my development time working on NPC implementation and neglected some other parts that were a little more important, like testing.<br>
I have a knack for being oblivious to the priorities in these kinds of projects, and it showed a bit in this project.<br>
I only was able to implement a handful of unit tests at the last minute, but given a bit more time, I feel confident I could get a decent amount of the code covered with unit testing.<br>
The tendency is to spend the majority of one’s time on playtesting, since it feels more intuitive and useful in some respects, but unit tests definitely have their place in a project like this, regardless.</p>
<h2 id="what-doesnt-work">What doesn’t work</h2>
<p>There isn’t really anything that doesn’t work, although there is a lot more functionality that is yet to be added.<br>
The only real issue is that the user must cargo run from inside the src/ directory to play the game, since the file-paths used in the code are all relative. This is an issue that I was not able to spend enough time on to solve, but is surely solvable.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>I learned a lot about Rust, predictably. The borrow checker and I got very well acquainted. I feel like I understand a lot more about the how a rust program is set up (module structures, etc.) than I did before. Doc comments were a fun thing to figure out, and are really quite nice. And of course, I got another lesson in managing time and priorities.</p>
