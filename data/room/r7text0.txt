You find yourself in a room filled with clothing.
The clothes are all neatly folded and stacked.
There appears to be a table in the corner, perhaps for folding.
Barring that, the room is empty.
A large metal door sits at the northern end of the room.
The door is marked with a sign that reads "EXIT".
