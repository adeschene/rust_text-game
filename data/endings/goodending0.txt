You push your way through the door.
As the door shuts behind you, it
becomes clear that you did not think
this through properly.

You find yourself face to face with
a large man in a jailor's uniform.

"Hey! It's about time one of you
 showed up. The jailor's break room
 is filthy, and we got escapees to
 worry about, as you can see."

Just then, another jailor brings
the man who broke through the
door around the corner in chains.

"Well, what are you waiting for?
 Get to work!"

You head off in the direction the
jailor pointed out, eventually find
the exit, and head out.

Congratulations! You escaped!
