You push your way through the door.
As the door shuts behind you, it
becomes clear that you did not think
this through properly.

You find yourself face to face with
a large man in a jailor's uniform.

"Ha! Another one, eh?
 You and your friend here
 aren't going anywhere."

Just then, another jailor brings
the man who broke through the
door around the corner in chains.

As they take him to the door, it
opens up and the old man from before
steps through and puts his hand on
your shoulder.

"I told you before, you have to wear
 your uniform at all times, else you
 be mistaken for a wandering prisoner."

He explains to the jailor that you're
a newly hired janitor, gives you "your"
uniform, and then offers to escort you
out of the jail. The jailor agrees with
a shrug, and you head out.

Congratulations! You escaped!
