"MY NAIL! ALMIGHTY IRON SAVIOR!"

You go to extend your hand out and give him the nail,
but before you can, he lunges at your hand
and awkwardly plucks the nail out of your hand.

"I'll have you open in no time at all, baby..."

Forgetting about you, once again,
he starts trying to thwart the lock
with renewed gusto and confidence.

Several seconds later, you hear a loud click.

"Ah! Got it! I'm actually out!"

Before you can even react,
he opens the door and stumbles through.
The door swings shut behind him.
