The second you open your mouth to speak,
he spins around, sees you, and flinches violently.

"Whoa! Oh, hey! My old neighbor!

 I would've broke you out myself,
 but I didn't want to risk--"

He interrupts himself, smacking his head in frustration.

 That nail got me out of my cell,
 but I must've dropped it somewhere
 in the there before I left,
 because I DON'T HAVE IT NOW!"

He stops talking and goes back to fidgeting with the lock.
