"Hey!
 How'd you get out?!
 Well, I guess I won't tell the guards.
 I mean, you kind of earned it..."

He looks you up and down.

"Tell you what.
 If you want to keep my mouth shut,
 you'll have to do something for me.
 I need you to get into the storage room and find my broom.
 I would go get it myself, but I'm extremely lazy."

His face goes blank and he stares into space for a moment.

"Anyways, the storage room is northeast of here.
 Find it and bring it back to me. And hurry up!
 This place needs cleaning!"
