I was born 87 years ago.

For 65 years I've ruled as Tamriel's Emperor.

But for all these years I have never been the ruler of my own dreams.

I have seen the Gates of Oblivion, beyond which no waking eye may see.

Behold, in Darkness a Doom sweeps the land.

This is the 27th of Last Seed; the Year of Akatosh 433.

These are the closing days of the 3rd Era, and the final hours of my life.
